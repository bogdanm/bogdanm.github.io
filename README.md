# Bogdan's blog

My attempt at blogging with github, after getting fed up with blogger and wordpress.

Based mostly on [poole](http://github.com/poole/poole) and [this post](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/)

CSS boxes (warning, error and so on) based on https://github.com/paulund/css-notification-boxes
